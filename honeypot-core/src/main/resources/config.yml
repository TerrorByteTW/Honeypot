# WorldGuard and Lands both have integrations with this plugin as well, however they do not have configurable settings.
# WorldGuard will register a flag which can be used to toggle whether or not Honeypots are able to be created in a region
# Lands will automatically deny building Honeypots in a claimed area. This is not changeable at the current time.
# Please remember that existing Honeypots will still function normally if an area is claimed where Honeypots already are.
