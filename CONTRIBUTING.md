## How to contribute to Honeypot

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/TerrorByteTW/Honeypot/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/TerrorByteTW/Honeypot/issues/new/choose). Be sure to include your **error logs** from console (If able), your **Honeypot logs** if enabled, and a **video or screenshot** showing the problem.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Your PR will be reviewed and, if more information is needed, will be requested via the PR. Be sure to have notifications turned on!

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Honeypot will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [Honeypot discussions](https://github.com/TerrorByteTW/Honeypot/discussions) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

* Changes that may hurt the ability to maintain or add functionality to Honeypot may be rejected, or modified to ensure the future of Honeypot.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Feel free to ask questions in the [discussions](https://github.com/TerrorByteTW/Honeypot/discussions) or on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Fegq2vtKCQ)!

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Honeypot documentation?**

* GitHub doesn't allow PRs for Wiki changes. However, you can open a Bug Report issue and contribute to it from there!

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
