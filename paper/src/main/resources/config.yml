# How many Honeypots to store in cache at any given time.
# Caching Honeypots stores Honeypot data in-memory, reducing PDC/SQLite queries when breaking Honeypots to retrieve information.
# Setting this to <= 0 will disable caching, slightly decreasing memory usage slightly but also *very* slightly increasing tick times
# Please see https://github.com/TerrorByteTW/Honeypot/wiki#faq for more info. If you don't know what this is, leave it alone
